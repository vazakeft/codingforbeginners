# cat.py - branches into kitty.py - Storing Functions and importing them for later use

#Define a function that supplies a default string value to its parameter for display
def purr(pet = 'A cat'):
        print(pet, 'Says MEOW!')

#Add two more function definitions that also supply default string values to their parameters for display
def lick(pet = 'A Cat'):
        print(pet, 'Drinks Milk')

def nap(pet = 'A Cat'):
        print(pet, 'Sleeps By The Fire')

#This program functionally does nothing, but it holds the functions purr, lick, and nap, as defined by "def"

#It will be imported into kitty.py
